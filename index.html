    <h1>How to Identify a Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Appearance: first impressions are very important, as follows:</strong
      >
      <br />
      <strong> Colour:</strong>Is it tempting and golden? If pallid it will be
      soggy, if too dark and over baked it will be dry. <br />
      Layering: can you see how the croissant has been constructed, a glimpse of
      the tale-tale layers which make up the structure of croissant is always
      reassuring.
      <br />
      <strong>Shape:</strong>
      it is lop-sided in the structure/in the bake. Note that in France a
      straight rather than a crescent shape indicates the use of margarine (and
      a lower price). A good rise: if a croissant looks deflated, it has not
      been proved (i.e. left to rise) enough, or it has been over proved â€“ the
      latter problem is common in hot weather. Is the point well sealed and
      tucked under the rolled croissant before it is shaped as a crescent on the
      baking sheet? If not, the dough will unravel as it rises in the oven and
      the croissant will collapse.
      <br />
      <br />

        apart:</strong
      >
      <br />

      <strong>Lightness:</strong> if sticky, the croissant is under baked.
      Aroma: when you break open the croissant can you smell the butter and
      heady, yeasty dough?<br />
      <strong>Holes:</strong> big holes indicate dough that has risen too long
      before baking. <br />
      <strong>Chewiness:</strong> a good baked croissant is chewy without being
      tough. <br />
      <strong>Fluffiness:</strong> not a good sign, the dough was poorly
      kneaded. Flavor: should be buttery with only a whiff of yeast. Having the
      right, generous amount of butter is key. A true French croissant has a
      delicious taste which is hard to match outside France. The flour is
      different and so, above all, is the butter.
